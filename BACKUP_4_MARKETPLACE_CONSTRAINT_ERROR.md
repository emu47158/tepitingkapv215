- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ getUserMarketplaceItems function implemented and exported
- ❌ Database constraint creation blocked by existing invalid condition values (Error 23514)

ALTER TABLE marketplace_items ADD CONSTRAINT marketplace_items_condition_check 
CHECK (condition IN ('New', 'Like New', 'Good', 'Fair', 'Poor'));
